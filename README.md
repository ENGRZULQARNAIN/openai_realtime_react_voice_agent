## Introduction

ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) is a paradigm that combines reasoning with action, allowing applications to perform tasks based on user input. By incorporating the OpenAI Real-Time Voice API, this project enables voice interactions that trigger reasoning processes, connecting with various tools and services.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or later
- Node.js (for front-end interaction)
- Access to the OpenAI API
- Any additional libraries specified in the `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git](https://github.com/ENGRZULQARNAIN/openai_realtime_react_voice_agent.git
   cd openai_realtime_react_voice_agent
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   For Python:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   For Node.js (if applicable):

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the Server:**

   For Python backend:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   For Node.js frontend:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Interact via Voice:**

   Use your microphone to speak commands. The OpenAI Real-Time Voice API will process the audio and trigger appropriate actions based on your input.

3. **Connect with Tools:**

   The application can be configured to interact with various tools (e.g., Google Calendar, weather APIs). Update the integration settings in `config.py` to customize tool connections.

## Example Scenarios

- **Task Management:** Add, update, or delete tasks using voice commands.
- **Calendar Events:** Create or query calendar events with simple voice prompts.
- **Weather Updates:** Ask for the current weather or forecasts.
